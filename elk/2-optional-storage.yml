# In the PersistentVolume StorageClass, it is important to set volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer,
# otherwise a Pod might be scheduled on a host that cannot access the existing PersistentVolume.
# This setting isnâ€™t always applied by default on Cloud providers StorageClasses, but in most cases
# it is possible to create (or patch) StorageClasses to add the setting.
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
# The system cannot reuse a PersistentVolume with existing data from a different cluster. In this case
# Elasticsearch does not start, as it detects data that belongs to a different cluster. For this reason,
# it is recommended to use the Delete reclaim policy.
